# Choose something familiar to model after (sports team, restaurant, etc.)

# create checklist of concepts to include
  # class inheritance
  # interface inheritance
  # duck typing
  # encapsulation
  # polymorphism
  # collaborator objects
  # public, private, and protected methods
  # accessor methods
  # namespacing
  # class variables - class variables are useful for storing common state tied to the class rather than specific instances

# provide code snippets using model to demonstrate concept

# refine snippets

# practice - quiz yourself by writing code from scratch to illustrate different concepts

# leave lots of notes as you go to improve understanding

# some things to consdier reflecting on and annotating:
  # when would I use this concept? - What is a classic use case?
  # does the real world situation im modeling here feel like it would be better modeled with a different structure? (when illustrating polymorphism, you may come to realize the nouns you are using to illustrate duck typing would make more sense in a common class inheritance structure, or vice versa)

# For each concept make sure to understand 3 key points:
  # definition
  # implementation
  # benefits

# Interview assessment (2 parts)
  # explain OOP concepts out-loud while providing YOUR OWN code snippets to demonstrate concept
  # given code examples, explain what will be output. Also will be asked how to fix the code so that it works properly.

# Go over quizzes and re-format questions to re-quiz yourself
